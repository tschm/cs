# The 10-line CTA
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tschm/cs/HEAD)

Challenged by a young CEO I wrote a terse CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) investment strategy. I discuss the somewhat quirky background of my code fragment.
Convex Programming opens the door to deeper insights into the 10 line strategy. I will boost the Sharpe Ratio and control both Kurtosis and trading costs.

I will rely on Python and Binder. 

You can run the software underlying this talk using docker
```
docker run -p "8888:8888" tschm/cs:latest
```
on your local machine. 

You may not have access to docker. In this case run the software by launching the Binder service.
