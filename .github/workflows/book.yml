# Workflow for building and deploying the Jupyter Book documentation
# This workflow is triggered on push events and performs the following tasks:
# 1. Builds Marimo notebooks and exports them to HTML
# 2. Builds Jupyter notebooks into a book
# 3. Combines all artifacts and deploys them to GitHub Pages

name: deploy-book

# Trigger the workflow on push events
# This ensures the documentation is automatically updated whenever code changes are pushed
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main


# This workflow contains multiple jobs that run in parallel and sequentially
jobs:
  # Job to build Marimo interactive notebooks and export them to HTML
  # This converts Python files in the book/marimo directory to interactive web pages
  marimo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Use the latest Ubuntu runner

  # This converts Jupyter notebooks to a static website with navigation
