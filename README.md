# [The 10-line CTA](http://tschm.github.io/cs)

Challenged by a young CEO I wrote a terse CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) investment strategy. I discuss the somewhat quirky background of my code fragment.
Convex Programming opens the door to deeper insights into the 10 line strategy. I will boost the Sharpe Ratio and control both Kurtosis and trading costs.

I compile a Jupyter Book that will allow you to run experiments online using Binder.
